The CHOP R User group has more than 400 members from all departments. This is great place to network with other R users, get help with coding problems, and learn about new packages, webinars, and conferences. We also have semi-regular meetings and workshops, like this one. \n\n:::\n\n## Come to R Office Hours!\n\n- Set up a meeting to get live help with your R code from our most experienced useRs\n- Office hours appointments can be one-on-one or open to the community\n\nLink to calendar: [https://bit.ly/chopROfficeHours](https://bit.ly/chopROfficeHours)\n\n::: aside\nWe're looking for more volunteers to lead appointments! Get in touch: hartmanr1@chop.edu\n:::\n\n::: notes\nWe have regular office hours appointments available to get R help. \nWe're offering two kinds of appointments: one-on-one, if you want individual help, or open appointments that are more of a community conversation about whatever R questions people bring up that day. The open appointments can be particularly valuable to attend if you want to hear other people's questions about R but maybe don't have a project of your own that you're troubleshooting at the moment. \nWe set up a calendar online where you can book an appointment. \n[click] And if you like this idea and you're an experienced R user yourself, consider joining us to offer appointments! It's just whatever times work for you, so we can set up a schedule around whatever other work you've got going on. Reach out to me via email or slack for details.  \n:::\n\n## These slides aren't done :)\n\nWe'll update the content here as the workshop date gets closer. \n",
