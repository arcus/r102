::: notes
Just a few announcements before we get started. 
For anyone here today that isn't already part of the CHOP R User group, I strongly encourage you to join (it is also open to Penn folks). The CHOP R User group has more than 400 members from all departments. This is great place to network with other R users, get help with coding problems, and learn about new packages, webinars, and conferences. We also have semi-regular meetings and workshops, like this one.

## Come to R Office Hours!

- Set up a meeting to get live help with your R code from our most experienced useRs
- Office hours appointments can be one-on-one or open to the community

We're looking for more volunteers to lead appointments! Get in touch: hartmanr1@chop.edu

::: notes
We have regular office hours appointments available to get R help. 
We're offering two kinds of appointments: one-on-one, if you want individual help, or open appointments that are more of a community conversation about whatever R questions people bring up that day. The open appointments can be particularly valuable to attend if you want to hear other people's questions about R but maybe don't have a project of your own that you're troubleshooting at the moment. 
We set up a calendar online where you can book an appointment. 
[click] And if you like this idea and you're an experienced R user yourself, consider joining us to offer appointments! It's just whatever times work for you, so we can set up a schedule around whatever other work you've got going on. Reach out to me via email or slack for details.

## These slides aren't done :)
